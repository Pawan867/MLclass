NumPy:
- Stands Forn Numerical Python
- NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays
- NumPy is array is acollection of homegeneous data type stored in contiguous memory location
- Has function for working in domain of libear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
- Writ partially in python, but parts that require fast computation are written in c or c++
- Source code of NumPy is located at github repository
https://github.com/numpy/numpy

Why NumPy is Fast?
- An array is a collection of homegeneous data type that are stored in contiguous memory location
- Vectorized operation are possible in NumPy
- NumPy package integrates C C++, and Fortran codes in python
