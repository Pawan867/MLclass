Hypothesis Testing:
1.Evaluate Mutual Exclusive relation on Population based on sample Data
i.Gender
	male 		Balance
	female	---
	male		Imbalance

Step of Hypothesis Testing:
- null and alternative[set null hypothesis(Assumption) (h0) -> balance]
- test size and to obtain the critical value.[collect Data]
-compute the test statistic.[Gather evidance to reject or not null hypothesis]

Types of Hypothesis testing:
gender	Age	weight	height			
male	E	70	7.8			
female	A	80	7.9			
male	A	55	6.1			
male	C	60	5.3
female	A	33	5.2

Data	One Population Sample Data

h0	There is no difference

h1	There is Difference  (after p_value<=0.05(hreshold) this data is difference or not find)

test	One population sample test - T = (X̄ – μ) / S/√n
				
[p_value<=0.05(hreshold)]


Data	Two Categorical

h0	There is no difference

h1	There is Difference  (after p_value<=0.05(hreshold) this data is difference or not find)

test	Chi-Square Test - χ2 = ∑(Oi – Ei)2/Ei,


Data	Continuous Data

h0	There is no difference

h1	There is Difference  (after p_value<=0.05(hreshold) this data is difference or not find)

test	T-test	- 


Data	Two Numerical Data

h0	There is no difference

h1	There is Difference  

test	Correlation (T-test) - t=r√(n−21−r2).
