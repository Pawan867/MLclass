Can we reshape to any shape?
Yes, as long as element required for reshaping are equal in both shapes.

Q. Convert 1D array with 8 elements to a 2D array with shape (3, 3)
. This process raise an exception, since there are 8 elements before reshaping and 9 elemnts after reshaping
.for reshaping to happrn, number of elements before reshapng


Joining Arrays:
concatenate
. concatenate 1D array
. concatenate 2D array (axis=0)
.splitting array:
Splitting is reverse operations of Joining
Joining merges multiple arrays into one
splitting breaks one array into multiple array
can be implemented using numpy functins:
. numpy.split()
.numpy.array_split()
we pass array we want to split and the number of split.
sub arrays obtained after splitting is only view of the original arrays
.changes made to the sub-arrays also reflect changes in the original array

Numpy Universal Function (Ufuncs)
. Looping over the array to perform repeated task like addition,substraction,etc on each array elements are common
. computation time to perform such repeated task increase with relatively large data
.NumPy makes this faster by using vectorized operation ,
